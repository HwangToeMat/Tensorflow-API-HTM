**Carry out various projects by using tensorflow-API.**

## 0. Open-Images_EasyDownload 
Easiest way to get the Data for Deep Learning, by using “Open Images”.
<a href="https://github.com/HwangToeMat/Open-Images_EasyDownload">Helper library for downloading OpenImages categorically.</a>

## 1. Classification <a href="https://github.com/HwangToeMat/Tensorflow-API-HTM/blob/master/1.classification/reCAPTCHA_classification.ipynb">[Break through the reCAPTCHA]</a>
Break through the security program for prevent ing macros, reCAPTCHA , using pretrained model<a href='http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz'>[Inception_Net]</a>.
As you can see in the picture below, Inception_Net makes it easy to find a bus.

## 2. Object_detection <a href="https://github.com/HwangToeMat/Tensorflow-API-HTM/blob/master/2.object_detection">[Football play detection]</a>
We used **ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco<a href="http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_05_09.tar.gz">[Download Link]</a>** to analyze soccer games in real time because we *need fast computing speed.* But as you can see in the image below, our model(Left) performs very well even though it is a lightweight model.
